    <h1>Community Service</h1>
    <p>Community Service is very important to me, and I have performed hundreds of hours of community service.
      I strongly believe in the principle of servant leadership, in which a leader "serves" those around him/her through their leadership role.</p>
    <h2>Ravenscroft Key Club</h2>
    <p>As a student at Ravenscroft School, I served in multiple leadership positions in my school's Key Club, including President my senior year. In this role,
     I coordinated community service opportunities for over 200 students. I recieved several awards during my time, including the Carolinas Key Club Top Fundraiser Award for Children's Miracle Network several years in a row.
     This award was a result of the Swimathon fundraiser that I organized every year, through which thousands of dollars were raised for Duke Children's Hospital.</p>
     <h1>Hobbies/Activities</h1>
     <h2>Swimming</h2>
     <p>I have been a competetive swimmer for the majority of my life. I currently swim as a member of RPI Swim and Dive, an NCAA Division III team.<br>
     In high school, I swam for the Marlins of Raleigh club team, and was a captain of the Ravenscroft Swim Team.<br>
     I mainly swim distance and butterfly.</p>
     <h2>Percussion</h2>
     <p>I have played Percussion since the 4th grade. I prefer to play mallet percussion, with my favorite instruments being the marimba and the vibraphone.</p>
